# Billing Software Requirements Specification

## 1. System Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Frontend: Tkinter
- **Purpose**: Create a lightweight, native desktop application interface
- **Key Advantages**:
  * Comes built-in with Python
  * Low resource consumption
  * Quick development cycle
  * Cross-platform compatibility
- **Recommended Approach**:
  * Use modern Tkinter widgets (Treeview, Notebook)
  * Implement responsive design principles
  * Create modular UI components for easy maintenance

### 1.2 Backend: SQLite Database
- **Purpose**: Provide a simple, embedded database solution
- **Key Characteristics**:
  * Zero-configuration database
  * Serverless architecture
  * Direct integration with Python
  * Suitable for small to medium-scale applications
- **Limitations and Considerations**:
  * Limited concurrent write support
  * Not ideal for high-concurrency scenarios
  * Potential future migration path to more robust databases

### 1.3 Programming Language: Python
- **Rationale for Python**:
  * Rapid development capabilities
  * Extensive library ecosystem
  * Strong text processing and database integration
  * Readable and maintainable code
- **Recommended Python Version**:
  * Python 3.8+ (for type hinting and performance improvements)

## 2. Authentication System

### 2.1 Security Architecture
- **Authentication Mechanism**:
  * Secure login process using bcrypt for password hashing
  * Role-based access control (RBAC)
  * Centralized user management

### 2.2 User Roles
1. **Admin Role**:
   * Full system access
   * Can manage:
     - User accounts
     - Product catalog
     - Customer records
     - Payment configurations

2. **Staff Role**:
   * Limited permissions
   * Can:
     - Create invoices
     - Process payments
     - View restricted customer and product information

### 2.3 Password Security
- **Hashing Strategy**:
  * Use bcrypt for one-way password encryption
  * Generate unique salt for each password
  * Store only hashed passwords in database
- **Security Best Practices**:
  * Implement password complexity requirements
  * Add login attempt tracking
  * Consider implementing two-factor authentication in future iterations

## 3. Database Schema Design

### [Database Tables](Database Schema.md)


## 4. Feature Implementations

### 4.1 Login System
- **Authentication Flow**:
  1. User enters credentials
  2. Validate username
  3. Compare hashed password
  4. Determine user role
  5. Route to appropriate dashboard
- **Error Handling**:
  * Provide clear feedback for invalid credentials
  * Implement login attempt limits

### 4.2 Product Management
- **CRUD Operations**:
  * Create new products
  * Update existing product details
  * Delete products
  * Real-time stock tracking
- **Validation Mechanisms**:
  * Prevent negative stock entries
  * Enforce unique product names
  * Validate pricing information

### 4.3 Customer Management
- **Features**:
  * Add new customer records
  * Update existing customer information
  * Delete customer profiles
- **Search Capabilities**:
  * Quick lookup by name, email, or phone
  * Fuzzy search implementation

### 4.4 Invoice Generation
- **Capabilities**:
  * Dynamic product selection
  * Quantity adjustment
  * Automatic total calculation
  * Optional discount application
- **Export Functionality**:
  * Generate PDF invoices
  * Use libraries like ReportLab or FPDF

### 4.5 Payment Processing
- **Payment Methods**:
  * Cash
  * Credit/Debit Card
  * Online Payment Gateways (future expansion)
- **Tracking Mechanisms**:
  * Link payments to specific invoices
  * Track payment status
  * Generate payment alerts for pending transactions

## 5. Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Database schema design
- Authentication system implementation
- Basic UI structure

### Phase 2: Core Modules
- Product management module
- Customer management module
- Invoice generation system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Payment processing
- Reporting and analytics
- PDF export functionality

### Phase 4: Optimization
- Performance tuning
- Security hardening
- User experience refinements

## 6. Potential Challenges and Mitigations

### 6.1 Concurrency Limitations
- **Current Approach**: SQLite with file locks
- **Future Scalability**: 
  * Consider PostgreSQL for multi-user scenarios
  * Implement connection pooling

### 6.2 Data Integrity
- Use database transactions
- Implement robust error handling
- Create comprehensive logging mechanism

### 6.3 Security Considerations
- Bcrypt password hashing
- Minimal database access privileges
- Regular security audits

## 7. Recommended Libraries
- Tkinter: GUI development
- SQLite3: Database management
- Bcrypt: Password security
- Datetime: Timestamp operations
- ReportLab/FPDF: Invoice generation

## Conclusion
This billing software provides a robust, scalable solution for small to medium-sized businesses, with a clear focus on security, usability, and future extensibility.
